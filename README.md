### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ruben, a Belgian software developer with a passion for creating anything I can think of. At the moment, I successfully achieved a Bachelor's degree of Applied Computer Sciences at Ghent University College and am currently reaching for a Master's degree in Applied Computer Sciences at the KU Leuven. 

I like to learn new technologies and further advance my current knowledge of them, and prefer to do that while working on a fun (and sometimes ridiculous) projects.

Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruben-naudts/) whenever you have any questions or want to work together.
